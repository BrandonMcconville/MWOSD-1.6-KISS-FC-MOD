# MWOSD-1.6-KISS-FC-MOD

This is a modified version of the MWOSD-1.6. 
For more information go to the [original project] (https://github.com/ShikOfTheRa/scarab-osd)


The goal of this mod was to include KISS-FC support for the MWOSD. The original Project has that implementation as well, but some features are still missing.

# Features:
* Horizon
* Voltage (from FC via KISS 24A ESC telemetry)
* Current (from FC via KISS 24A ESC telemetry)
* Used mAh (from FC)
* max ESC temperature (from FC via KISS 24A ESC telemetry)
* PID - table
